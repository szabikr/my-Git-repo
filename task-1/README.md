# Task 1

ðŸ‘‰ Write a function called `makeLegend`, which takes in a `name` (string) as its only argument. The function should return a new string which includes the name plus the words `'is now a legend.'`. For example, if the name given was `'Chris'`, the function would return the string `'Chris is now a legend.'`.

ðŸ‘‰ Using a for loop and the `makeLegend` function, create a new array which includes `'is now a legend'` for each item. Save this new array to the variable `legendaryCelebs`.

ðŸ‘‰ Use another for loop to produce a new array of all of the celebrity names which start with a vowel, and store that new array in a new variable called `vowelCelebs`.
